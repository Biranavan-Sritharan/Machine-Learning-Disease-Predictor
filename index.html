                To begin select one of the options above to test the likelihood of you getting this disease. There are 3 options to choose from and once you enter your 
                details into the corresponding fields, you will get a results that will be displayed below and will appear in a blue-red 'glow' so its easy to spot!
                Along with the probability of getting one of the listed disease, the software will also tell you the source of which input field is causing the greatest
                influence to your final result. Also it is recommended to view the webpage at a zoom value of 80%, or if you are experiencing any graphical problems. <br><br>
                
                If you have any questions or wondering about the result obtained, answers can be found in either the Extra Information Section of this webpage or the GitHub
                repository where the most in-depth reasoning and report of this project will be displayed.

                Some questions you may be asking, especially ones in regards to the accuracy of the probabilities calculated by the software.
                The way these probabilities are calculated is the use of datasets that have been sourced from the web. The website that these datasets
                are mostly from Kaggle.com where lots of public domain datasets are available to use. The accuracy of the probabilities given to you is
                heavily reliant on the accuracy of the datasets itself. So, if you are seeing something unusual, it is likely due to the nature of the dataset
                and not the calculation itself. The calculation performed to provide you with your probability value is Na√Øve Bayes. This method is a good way
                of calculating probabilities and uses machine learning to use the provided data to calculate the probability. The dataset is read and calculations are
                performed in JavaScript. There are no libraries/packages or API's used in this webpage so nothing needs to be installed if you were to run this webpage
                on your own machine. However previously in a different iteration of this webpage the csv2json and json2csv packages were used, but not anymore
                so if any association with this can be disregarded if seen. More Information available on the GitHub repository along with any requirements and anything to keep
                note of when running this webpage.
